My experimentation of model train dcc that uses RP2040 for dcc station and dcc decoder

youtube demo ---

open source dcc locomotive decoder using RP2040 pico --- https://ilabs.se/product/opendec02/

RP2040 decoder github --- https://github.com/PontusO/RP2040-Decoder

RP2040 dcc station github --- https://github.com/pico-cs/firmware

on the pictures folder there is a picture of dcc track interface to 3.3v RP2040 pico I found this on the Internet and works very well, unfortunately I lost the link and could not credit the person that made the interface.
